- dotenv (https://docs.rs/dotenv/0.15.0/dotenv/)
  This crate provides a configuration loader in the style of the ruby dotenv gem. This library is meant to be used on development or testing environments in which    setting environment variables is not practical.

  variables provided by the operating system.

- React Datatable (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-data-table-component)
  Creating yet another React table library came out of necessity while developing a web application for a growing startup. I discovered that while there are some 
  great table libraries out there, some required heavy customization, were missing out of the box features such as built in sorting and pagination, or required 
  understanding the atomic structure of html tables.
